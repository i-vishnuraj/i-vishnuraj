👋Hi, I’m Vishnuraj Rajendran

A Curious Databeing wandering the Planet :earth_asia: with a sole purpose to understand life through data. You might not see much repos in here since I was lost. But now I have regained the interest and aspirations. 

- :hearts: I am an **AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate** and an **ITIL v4** Professional.

- 👀 I’m interested in learning, sharing and growning. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python from the start. Polishing the corners of knowledge to make it shine :gem:

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects for **Python** :snake:, **Machine Learning** :robot:, **NLP** :speaking_head: and **Data Science** :chart_with_upwards_trend: :microscope:
